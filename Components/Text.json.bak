[color=#4f80a0]Pre-containment Procedures:[/color] A temporary drilled entry point near the top of Miánhua cave will be used for entry while research takes place. Full decontamination of all individuals upon exiting the cavern to prevent the potential spread of SCP-XXXX outside of Miánhua cave is required.

Potential anomalous properties of Miánhua cave SCP-XXXX the ecosystem within it are currently being researched. No life support equipment is required within the cavern for healthy individuals.

[color=#4f80a0]Description:[/color] SCP-XXXX is a prolific black wool-like alga that grows at the bottom of the saltwater pools in Miánhua cave, a sealed cavern intercepted at approximately 29 meters beneath the surface in the Yunnan province, China.

{energySource}

SCP-XXXX has adapted to rely on several ketones for respiration and does not require glucose. Its cells resemble algae in the Oedogonium genus but do not contain chloroplasts.  SCP-XXXX’s cells contain an autapomorphic organelle closely resembling ctenophore cells. This form of autotrophy has created an ecosystem made up entirely of carnivores.

SCP-XXXX, and all life in the ecosystem it supports, are endemic to the cavern. Currently, [color=#4f80a0]{species} species[/color](including SCP-XXXX) have been described within the ecosystem and none besides SCP-XXXX have been observed to be anomalous. All described species rely exclusively on dietary ketones but produce glucose for respiration through gluconeogenesis as is typical of carnivores.

All are descended from marine species that have split somewhere from 485-462 mya. It is currently estimated the cave was sealed off sometime between the early to mid-Ordovician period.{cavesDiscovered}

If entrance into Miánhua cave is essential,  expeditions require approval from two Level 4 personnel, a team of at least 5 individuals, and enough food and water for 2 weeks.

[color=#4f80a0]Addendum:[/color] Two expeditions into Miánhua cave have taken place. The first expedition was completed without complication by a team of 5, Dr. Sanghera and four MTF operatives stationed in the Yunnan province on December 20th, 2023. 7/{species} of the known species, including SCP-XXXX, were described during this expedition. Due to the success of the first expedition and the low perceived risk, a second expedition with a two-person team, Dr. Sanghera and Agent Chen, was approved and carried out on December 23rd 2023. On entry into the cavern, a cave-in occurred. Agent Chen was killed immediately{ending}
