"scpText":"[color=#4f80a0]Provisional Object Class:[/color] Safe

[color=#4f80a0]Pre-containment Procedures:[/color] A drilled entry point near the top of the cave will be used for entry and exit into the anomaly and the ecosystem that surrounds it while research takes place. Potential anomalous properties of the cave SCP-7784 resides within are currently being researched. No life support equipment is required within the cavern for healthy individuals. [i]Due_to_minimal_risk_and_the_breathability of_the_atmosphere, only_small_teams_with minimal_equipment_are_necessary.[/i] [color=#4f80a0]So much for that.[/color]

[color=#4f80a0]Description:[/color] SCP-7784 is a black wool-like alga that grows at the bottom of the saltwater pools in a sealed cave intercepted at approximately 29 meters beneath the surface in the Yunnan province, China.

SCP-7784’s primary source of energy is hypothesized to be a form of anomalous thermosynthesis that produces ketones, methane, and oxygen. Due to this, the oxygen and methane content of the cave is elevated compared to the broader atmosphere of Earth, but it remains safely breathable. 

SCP-7784 has adapted to completely remove the need for glucose and instead relies on several ketones for respiration. Its cells resemble algae in the Oedogonium genus but do not contain chloroplasts. The specimen contains an autapomorphic organelle that shares some key resemblances to fungal spores.

SCP-7784, and all life in the ecosystem it supports, are endemic to the cavern. Currently, [color=#4f80a0]{species} species[/color](including SCP-7784) have been described within the ecosystem and none besides SCP-7784 have been observed to be anomalous. The majority of the supported species rely exclusively on dietary ketones but do produce glucose via gluconeogenesis.

All are descended from marine species that have split somewhere from 485-462 mya. It is currently estimated the cave was sealed off sometime between the early to mid-Ordovician period.
